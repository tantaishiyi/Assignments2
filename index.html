                Chicken Dishes: Yakitori: Yakitori is a traditional Japanese skewered chicken dish. It typically consists of bite-sized pieces of chicken, chicken skin, or other parts grilled over charcoal. The grilling process imparts a unique smoky flavor to the chicken, resulting in a crispy exterior and juicy interior. Yakitori is usually seasoned in two ways: with salt (shio) or with a savory-sweet sauce (tare). This delightful snack is popular in Japanese izakayas (pubs) and street stalls alike. Karaage. Karaage is Japanese-style fried chicken, celebrated for its crispy exterior and juicy interior. The preparation involves marinating chicken pieces (usually thigh meat) in a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and ginger, then coating them in potato starch before deep-frying. Served hot with a wedge of lemon, Karaage offers a refreshing burst of flavor with each bite. Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with various ingredients such as raw fish, seafood, and vegetables. The rice, known as "shari," is often seasoned with vinegar, sugar, and salt. The toppings or fillings can be raw or cooked fish, seafood, eggs, or vegetables.
